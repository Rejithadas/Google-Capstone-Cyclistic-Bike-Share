**ABOUT COMPANY**

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a popular bike-sharing programme with more than 5,824 bikes that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations throughout Chicago.Bikes can be unlocked at any time and brought back to any other station in the network.

Untill now, Cyclistic's marketing approach attempted to increase public awareness and appeal to a wide range of consumers.

One tactic that made these things possible was the price plans flexibility, which allowed for single-ride passes, full-day permits, and annual memberships. 

Those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders while those who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
