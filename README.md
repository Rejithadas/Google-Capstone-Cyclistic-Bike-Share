<b>ABOUT COMPANY<b/>

In 2016, [Cyclistic](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/aacF81H_TsWnBfNR_x7FIg_36299b28fa0c4a5aba836111daad12f1_DAC8-Case-Study-1.pdf?Expires=1674086400&Signature=BnSemZf2ioylF4NN6rTNdrlqn81Cb-nIiF68gtwX2jymVCLdUXsZFKyuz7s2XVdg15F84dOeieHXnMdXwqTDiWXgtZF5mdCSKy93ELLLx86~S8WDwc9xb66QvBTEeW53oksvX5lJPk~JO~~6mWk2AY9VwtjxLC3QdK5rOG2K2nI_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A) launched a popular bike-sharing programme with more than 5,824 bikes that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations throughout Chicago.Bikes can be unlocked at any time and brought back to any other station in the network.<br/>Untill now, Cyclistic's marketing approach attempted to increase public awareness and appeal to a wide range of consumers.One tactic that made these things possible was the price plans flexibility, which allowed for single-ride passes, full-day permits, and annual memberships.Those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders while those who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.<br/>Our finance analysts concluded that annual members are much more profitable than Casual riders and my manager, Lily Moreno believed that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. She also thought there was a great possibility to turn casual riders into members rather than developing a marketing strategy that targeted only new clients.<br/>In conclusion, we need to figure out how to turn casual riders into members.

**GOAL**<br/>
In this scenario I am a junior data analyst at Cyclistic and my team has been tasked with the overall goal to identify the trends by analyzing Cyclistic's historical bike trip data.
But before analyzing the data, I asked a few questions to myself and these questions helped me to give direction and structure to my analysis.<br/>1.How do annual members and Casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?<br/>2.Why would Casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?<br/>3.How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence Casual riders to become members?

ANALYSIS<br/>
I first downloaded the bike share consumer data from [divvy-tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html), analyzed the data in Excel, then used [SQL](https://github.com/Rejithadas/Google-Capstone-Project/blob/main/cycle.sql) to analyze the data as a whole (one year). 
Finally I created a dashboard in Power BI.
<br/>Cyclistic provided a total of 6 million rides to its customers, with Cyclistic members accounting for 3 million rides and Casual riders accounting for 2 million rides.<br/> The average ride length for all users is 16.01 minutes,while Cyclistic Members only rode for 12.35 minutes on average, Casual riders rode for 21.32 minutes on average.
